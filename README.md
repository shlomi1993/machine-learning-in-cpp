# Machine Learning in C++

Implementation and code examples of machine learning algorithms in C++. Includes ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), KNN (supervised learning), K-Means (unsupervised learning), and neural networks.

# Work In Progress...

## To-do
- Fix KNN - it is compiled and run, but low performance...
- Complete neural networks
- LI ?
- 1-Cher-a-Day + implement advanced part
- - RPI5 C++ code examples
